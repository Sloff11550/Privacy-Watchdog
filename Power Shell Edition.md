### üõ°Ô∏è Repair Shop Watchdog - PowerShell Edition

> üí¨ **Why this exists:**
>
> In a perfect world, you could trust every repair technician with your data. But in reality, not all techs are honest‚Äîand not all laptops allow you to remove your hard drive. Many modern systems have **soldered internal storage**, meaning you can't just pop out the drive before handing your device over.
>
> **Privacy Watchdog** acts like a dashcam for your PC. It silently watches for activity‚ÄîUSB connections, opened folders, and screen behavior‚Äîso you have proof of what happened while your machine was out of your sight. It creates accountability in places where it usually doesn't exist.


This is a lightweight PowerShell version of the Repair Shop Watchdog script. It focuses on what PowerShell can do effectively without external dependencies:

- üîå Logs USB connection/disconnection events
- üì∏ Captures screenshots when USB events are detected
- üìÅ Stores logs and screenshots in hidden AppData folders

This script is useful for users who prefer a native, built-in solution without Python dependencies. While it lacks keylogging and video recording due to PowerShell limitations, it is still a powerful and silent tool for monitoring suspicious activity during repair scenarios.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use this responsibly. This tool is for protecting your own data and system while it's in someone else‚Äôs hands (e.g. repair shops). Do not use it for spying or unethical surveillance.
