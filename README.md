### üß© Project Overview

> ‚öñÔ∏è **Know Your Rights:**
>
> Accessing or copying your private files without permission‚Äîespecially when unrelated to the repair‚Äîis a violation of your privacy and may be illegal. In many regions, unauthorized access to personal data is grounds for civil action or criminal charges.
>
> **Privacy Watchdog** empowers you with tamper-proof logs and silent monitoring, so you‚Äôll know exactly what happened while your system was in someone else‚Äôs hands. It‚Äôs not just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a witness.


> üí¨ **Why this exists:**
>
> In a perfect world, you could trust every repair technician with your data. But in reality, not all techs are honest‚Äîand not all laptops allow you to remove your hard drive. Many modern systems have **soldered internal storage**, meaning you can't just pop out the drive before handing your device over.
>
> **Privacy Watchdog** acts like a dashcam for your PC. It silently watches for activity‚ÄîUSB connections, opened folders, keystrokes, and screen behavior‚Äîso you have proof of what happened while your machine was out of your sight. It creates accountability in places where it usually doesn't exist.


This script canvas contains the modular pieces and core logic for the Repair Shop Watchdog project. It includes:

- üñäÔ∏è Configurable directory paths
- üß† Keylogging
- üé• Screen recording
- üîå USB monitoring
- üîê AES encryption of logs
- üß∞ Optional silent `.pyw` execution or EXE bundling

# The final version will include:
# - Keylogger
# - Screen recorder
# - USB detection
# - AES encryption
# - Optional email or PushBullet log forwarding
# - Silent mode (.pyw or .exe)
# - Setup comments for user config (email/password/key/intervals)

# Begin with project layout and README design, code to follow.

## üìÑ Full Script (Copy Below)

```python
# üõ°Ô∏è Repair Shop Watchdog

A stealthy, privacy-focused script designed to monitor your PC while it‚Äôs left at repair shops. Records activity, encrypts it, and keeps everything hidden in plain sight. Think of it like a rootkit‚Äîbut for YOU.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Keylogger (records keystrokes)
- Screen recorder (continuous video capture)
- USB device logger (detects plug/unplug)
- AES encryption of all logs
- Stealth folder structure
- Modular and easy to configure
- Optional EXE packaging for one-click silent use

---

## üß™ Installation Instructions

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- **Python 3.9 or higher**
  - Download: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### üì¶ Required Packages
Install the required dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install pynput opencv-python mss psutil cryptography
```

---

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Run the script using Python:
```bash
python watchdog.pyw
```

2. When prompted, enter a path where logs should be stored. You can leave it blank to default to:
```
~/AppData/Roaming/SteamHelper
```

3. The script will begin recording silently:
   - Keystrokes go to `/logs/keys.log`
   - USB activity goes to `/logs/usb_events.log`
   - Video recording goes to `/recordings/screen_record.avi`

4. When interrupted (CTRL+C), all files are encrypted.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements
- Auto-detect/install Python if not present
- Create GUI setup wizard
- Add optional remote log upload or alerts
- One-click EXE builder script with PyInstaller

# - Add automated Python installer detection with subprocess or `os.system()`
# - Create EXE bundler version for single-click execution
# - Optionally add GUI for friendly user configuration
